# uProjection - Unity Project Template Creator, Manager and Generator

Unity in project Project Template Creator, Manager and Generator

## Requirements

- Unity 2018.x
- Unity 2019.x

## Why?

I often have several smaller projects co-located within a single Unity project.  
This is to save time on re-importing dependent assets, but I had to create the same directory structure each time.  
That didn't save much time in the end, so I created this editor extension.
